 How to fix corruption of the container when the process is killed during a stash:
    While has bytes left to stash
        Find empty block or loop until tables are reached
        If empty block,
            Write to disk
            Continue
        Else (at beginning of tables)
            Store position
            Move to end of tables
            Calculate size of tables in bytes
            Subtract size of tables from bytes remaining
            Write difference out as all zeroes
            Once container has been expanded enough to fit the file, write out the tables again
            Write an entry in the new blob table for the new file
            Update the table positions in memory and in the file
            Flush buffer to disk
            Jump back to stored position
            Overwrite everything with the new file (should go up to the new tables)

    This is not a perfect solution, but the best one I can come up with right now. The only issue I can think of would be
    forcibly stopping the process after the table positions have been updated but before the tables have been overwritten.
    This could leave the tables floating in the newly expanded part of the block section, which could lead to leaked disk
    space.
